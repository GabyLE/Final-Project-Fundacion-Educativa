# Step 1: Cleaning

- File `inscripcion_conferencia.csv` doesn't have null values or atypical values. The column age was added.
- File `estudiantes.csv`doesnn't have null nor atypical values. The column age was added.
- File `donantes_inscritos.csv`doesn't have null nor atypical values.
- File `donaciones.csv` has some null values within the column `Comentario`, which contains the reason of the donation, however they do not affect the analysis requested.

As seen above, the files were previously clean by the instructor and no further cleaning was necessary. Next step: [Exploration]()
